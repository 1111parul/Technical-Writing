# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## What is SDLC?
Explain the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and its importance in structured and systematic software development.

## Phases of SDLC
Describe each of the SDLC phases: Planning, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.

## Planning and Requirement Gathering
Discuss how the initial planning phase works and how requirements are gathered from stakeholders to define the project scope.

## System Design
Explain the system design phase, including architectural design, technology stack decisions, and system modeling.

## Development
Describe the actual coding phase where software is built, including version control, collaboration, and coding practices.

## Testing
Discuss the testing phase, including various types of testing (unit, integration, system, user acceptance), and their importance in ensuring software quality.

## Deployment
Explain the deployment phase, including the methods and tools used to release software to end-users and ensure proper installation.

## Maintenance and Updates
Describe the ongoing maintenance phase, which includes bug fixes, updates, and improvements post-deployment.

## SDLC Methodologies
Compare different SDLC methodologies, including Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, and DevOps, discussing their pros and cons in various contexts.

## Tools and Technologies for SDLC
List and describe tools and technologies that aid each SDLC phase, such as project management tools, version control, CI/CD, and testing tools.

## Risks in SDLC
Discuss common risks in the SDLC process, including scope creep, resource limitations, and security concerns, along with strategies for risk mitigation.

## Agile vs. Waterfall
Compare Agile and Waterfall models in terms of flexibility, speed, and suitability for different types of projects.

## Metrics for Measuring SDLC Success
Explain the key metrics used to measure the success and efficiency of the SDLC, such as time to market, bug rates, and customer satisfaction.

## Continuous Improvement in SDLC
Discuss how SDLC processes can be continuously improved based on feedback, retrospectives, and iterative changes.

## Future Trends in SDLC
Provide insights into how SDLC methodologies and practices are evolving with emerging technologies like AI, automation, and cloud development.

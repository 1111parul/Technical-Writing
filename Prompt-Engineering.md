# Prompt Engineering

## What is it?
<!--Explain the fundamentals of prompt engineering and its significance in optimizing language model interactions.-->
In today's modern world, Artificial Intelligence(AI) is increasingly being used to assist a wide range of tasks, from content creation to problem solving. In every possible field we can think of, we find AI being used. As AI models have become an integral part of our lives, the ability to effectively interact with them becomes crucial. This is where we start the discussion of Prompt Engineering.

The practice of designing and improving input text(prompt) which is entered to guide Large Language Models (LLM's) such as ChatGPT for producing desired output is termed as Prompt Engineering. It is all about structuring the instructions to get best possible output. In this, queries are structured in a way that maximizes the model's efficiency, performance and makes the conversation more meaningful.

### What is a Prompt?
A Prompt is a detailed text in natural language given to a model to get desired or expected output. It is an interaction between a user and an AI model. 

This process can be visualised as-

### Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering
The quality of the prompt directly affects the quality of the response. Hence, there are a few fundamentals need to be followed while interacting with a model.

#### 1. Clarity
Be clear about what is needed. If the prompt is vague, the output will also be vague.

#### 2. Context
Provide the model with enough background information to understand your need.

#### 3. Break into Steps
Rather than entering one big instruction, break down the complex task into smaller instructions.

#### 4. Use of Examples
Provide examples in your input to guide the model.

### Example of Good Prompt vs Bad Prompt

#### Bad Prompt
```bash
Write a blog post about machine learning.
```

#### Good Prompt
```bash
Write a 500-word blog post introducing machine learning. Cover its definition, key concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning, and practical applications in various fields. Include examples for better understanding.
```

### Role in Optimising Language Model Interactions
#### 1. Improved performance
Well structured prompts significantly impact the performance of AI models by providing proper guidance to the model thus leading to better accuracy and responses.

#### 2. Customization & Personalization
It helps users to frame their instructions specific to their task and needs. Users can customize their prompts enabling a more personalized AI interaction.

#### 3. Increased Efficiency
Structured interactions help in reducing the time which is spent on performing a task by streamlining the conversation.

#### 4. Improved Decision Making
It enables the users to obtain relevant information and insights, helping in making informed and data-driven decisions.

#### 5. Reduced Ambiguity
Clear and well-structured prompts help reduce ambiguity in AI responses and ensure that the output is relevant and fulfills user needs.

## Use cases
<!-- Document real-world applications and scenarios where prompt engineering plays a crucial role. -->
Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in various scenarios and serves diverse applications. The following are its real world
applications-
#### 1.Marketing
Prompt engineering helps in creating engaging content, posts, articles, slogans, advertisements and more. Eye catching marketing strategies are essential nowadays for improved businesses. E-commerce platforms like Flipkart, Zepto etc rely on high quality descriptions of their products to attract customers. Thus, well structured prompts become an important element to make AI work effectively.

#### 2.Automating Customer Support
By designing AI chatbots, businesses ensure that the model effectively answers to the frequently asked questions and guide the users when facing issues. Well structured prompts help the bot understand customer inquiries and develop useful responses.

#### 3.Healthcare
AI is increasingly used in the healthcare industry for medical diagnoses. Prompt Engineering can guide the models to analyze the patient's symptoms, medical history and provide the diagnoses. 

#### 4.Education
AI is now being integrated with educational tools. Students can use well-defined prompts for doubt clearing, receive more effective answers for questions and tailor the bot results according to the student's level of understanding.

#### 5.Sentiment Analysis
Brands make use of sentiment analysis to analyze the customer feedback and reviews. Prompts are created to identify the sentiment of a text so that companies can work on the negative reviews.

#### 6.Entertainment
AI model can respond according to the given prompt. Users can use AI for crafting stories or immersive narrartives for both children and adults. Users can get suggestions for which music to listen to according to the listener's emotional state.

#### 7.Job Applications
Prompt engineering can assist in drafting personalised letters and job application emails. By providing the details of job role and the applicant's experience and background, AI can generate the content which the applicant can use to increase the chances of getting noticed by recruiters.

#### 8.Finance
Prompt engineering can be used in the financial sector to automate the prediction process. By feeding in structured prompts such as historical data, market condition, company details, etc., AI can generate insights into the financial performance in future and make data driven decisions.

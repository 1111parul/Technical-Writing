# Prompt Engineering

## What is it?
<!--Explain the fundamentals of prompt engineering and its significance in optimizing language model interactions.-->
The practice of designing and improving inputs which are entered to guide AI models such as ChatGPT for producing desired output is termed as Prompt Engineering. It is all about structuring the instructions to get best possible output from LLM's (Large Language Models). In this, queries are structured in a way that maximises the model's efficiency, performance and makes the conversation more meaningful.

### What are prompts?
Prompts are detailed texts in natural language given to a model to get desired or expected output. It is an interaction between a user and an AI model. 

### Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering
#### Clarity
Be clear about what is needed. If the prompt is vague, the output is also effected in the same way.

#### Context
Provide the model with enough background information to understand your need.

#### Break into steps
Rather than entering one big instruction, break down the complex task into smaller instructions.

#### Use of examples
Provide examples in your input to guide the model.

### Role in Optimising Language Model Interactions
#### 1. Improved performance
Well structured prompts significantly impact the performance of AI models by providing proper guidance to the model thus leading to better accuracy and responses.

#### 2. Customization & Personalization
It helps the users to frame their instructions specific to their task and needs. Users can customise their prompts enabling a more personalized AI interaction.

#### 3. Increased Efficiency
Structured interactions help in reducing the time which is spent on perfoming a task by streamlining the conversations.

#### 4. Improved Decision Making
It enables the users to obtain relevant information and insights, helping in making informed and data-driven decisions.

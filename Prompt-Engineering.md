# Prompt Engineering

## What is it?
<!--Explain the fundamentals of prompt engineering and its significance in optimizing language model interactions.-->
The practice of designing and improving input text(prompt) which is entered to guide Large Language Models (LLM's) such as ChatGPT for producing desired output is termed as Prompt Engineering. It is all about structuring the instructions to get best possible output. In this, queries are structured in a way that maximizes the model's efficiency, performance and makes the conversation more meaningful.

### What is a Prompt?
A Prompt is a detailed text in natural language given to a model to get desired or expected output. It is an interaction between a user and an AI model. 

This process can be visualised as-

### Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering
The quality of the prompt directly affects the quality of the response. Hence, there are a few fundamentals need to be followed while interacting with a model.

#### 1.Clarity
Be clear about what is needed. If the prompt is vague, the output will also be vague.

#### 2.Context
Provide the model with enough background information to understand your need.

#### 3.Break into Steps
Rather than entering one big instruction, break down the complex task into smaller instructions.

#### 4.Use of Examples
Provide examples in your input to guide the model.

### Example of Good Prompt vs Bad Prompt

#### Bad Prompt
```bash
Write a blog post about machine learning.
```

#### Good Prompt
```bash
Write a 500-word blog post introducing machine learning. Cover its definition, key concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning, and practical applications in various fields. Include examples for better understanding.
```

### Role in Optimising Language Model Interactions
#### 1. Improved performance
Well structured prompts significantly impact the performance of AI models by providing proper guidance to the model thus leading to better accuracy and responses.

#### 2. Customization & Personalization
It helps users to frame their instructions specific to their task and needs. Users can customize their prompts enabling a more personalized AI interaction.

#### 3. Increased Efficiency
Structured interactions help in reducing the time which is spent on performing a task by streamlining the conversation.

#### 4. Improved Decision Making
It enables the users to obtain relevant information and insights, helping in making informed and data-driven decisions.

#### 5. Reduced Ambiguity
Clear and well-structured prompts help reduce ambiguity in AI responses and ensure that the output is relevant and fulfills user needs.
